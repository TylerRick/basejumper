h1. BaseJumper

There are others, I know, but this is how I like my apps to start out.  You probably won't like it, so move along.

Based on the Authlogic sample app (http://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic_example), password_resets branch.

Use as you will.  I may update it occasionally.  Offer suggestions.

h2. Gems

h3. Authlogic

The way I think authentication should be done.  

h3. Configatron

For application configuration.

h3. Searchlogic

Because eventually you need pagination, and then you get sorting and filtering when you need it.

h3. log-buddy

For the lazy debugger in all of us.

h3. rspec and rspec-rails

It just makes more sense to me.

h3. less

Nesting CSS rules, mixing in styles, and using variables in CSS is fun.

h2. Plugins

h3. active_form

Easy AR validations for non-AR models (for those Contact Us forms)

h3. active_scaffold

Fastest way to build a super simple admin interface.

h3. display_flash_helper

Shameless use of my own plugin to display flash messages

h3. exception_notification

Because they happen and I want to know about them.

h3. pretty_buttons

HTML buttons shouldn't have to look so bad.

h3. seo_helper

A few useful helpers for SEO purposes.
